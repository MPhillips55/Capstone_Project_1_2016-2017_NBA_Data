### Statistics Explanations

In the exploratory data analysis portion of my project I used two statistical methods to help analyze the data. 

First, I calculated r-squared for the regression lines in my scatter plots. This helped to explain how much spread there was in the underlying data and how well the regression line summarized that data. The values that I found lined up with my intuition from just looking at the data - team possessions was kind of all over the place, it was possible to succeed playing very different styles of basketball. Team assists was a little more closely grouped, with the r-squared value being around 36% and again agreeing with my visual interpetation of the scatter plot that more assists would generally lead to more wins. 

Second, I used z-tests to analyze population means for two groups of NBA teams - those that made the playoffs and those that did not. I chose this distinction because making the playoffs (for most teams anyway) is a good measurement of how the season went.
